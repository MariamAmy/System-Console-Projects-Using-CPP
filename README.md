# System-Console-Projects-Using-CPP

This repo contains some management systems that I built using C++ programming language.

● Hospital System
- Load and Save Data: Load and save patient data to/from a file.
- Add Patients: Add patients with specialization and urgency.
- Print Patients: View patient lists by specialization.
- Serve Patients: Serve the next patient in a specialization.
- User Interaction: Menu-driven interface for user actions.
- Queue Management: Handle patient queues based on urgency.
- Data Persistence: Save patient data for future use.
- Error Handling: Manage file operation errors.

● Queuing System
- Customer Management: Represents and tracks customers with arrival, waiting, and transaction times.
- Server Management: Manages server status (free or busy) and transaction times.
- Queue Management: Utilizes a specialized waiting queue for customers waiting to be served.
- Server List: Maintains a list of servers, tracking their statuses and transaction times.
- Simulation Parameters: Allows users to set key simulation parameters such as server count, transaction times, and arrival rates.
- Statistics Generation: Calculates and reports statistics, including total waiting time, customers served, etc.
- Modular Organization: Organizes code into separate classes and header files for clarity and reusability.
- User Interaction: Provides a menu-driven interface for users to input parameters and view results.
- Output and Reporting: Displays simulation results and statistics in the console.
- Simulation Loop: Manages the flow of time in the simulation, updating server and queue status.
- Random Arrival Modeling: Models customer arrivals based on random values and an exponential distribution.
- Dynamic Server Assignment: Dynamically assigns customers to available servers based on their status.
